## What is Bolio?

Imagine you're writing an email, filling out a form, or chatting online, and instead of typing, you could just speak your thoughts, and they magically appear as text. That's exactly what Bolio does! It's a smart little helper that lives in your web browser, turning your spoken words into written text in almost any text box you encounter on the internet.

## How Does Bolio Work for You?

Bolio is designed to be completely intuitive. It waits quietly until you need it.

### 1. The Icon Appears Automatically

When you click inside any text box on a webpage (like a search bar, an email composer, or a comment section), Bolio instantly shows a small, **grey microphone icon** right next to it. This grey icon is Bolio's way of saying, "I'm ready to listen whenever you are!"

```
+------------------------------------+
| A Text Box on a Website            |
+------------------------------------+
                                     [Mic] <--- Grey (inactive) icon appears automatically.
```

Bolio is smart about where it places the icon. It will try to place it above the text box, but if you're at the top of the screen, it will place it below, to the sideâ€”wherever is most convenient and out of your way.

### 2. Click to Start Speaking!

To start dictating, simply **click the grey microphone icon**. The moment you click it:
*   The icon will change to its **full, vibrant color**.
*   A clear **"Listening..."** message will appear.
*   A small **'X' button** will show up, giving you an easy way to stop.

```
+------------------------------------+
| A Text Box on a Website            |
+------------------------------------+
                                     [Mic][X] Listening... <--- Colored (active) icon.
```

Now, just speak clearly, and watch your words appear in the text box in real-time!

### 3. Two Powerful Dictation Modes

Bolio has two modes, easily switchable by clicking the badge on the corner of the icon.

#### a) Simple Mode (Default, badge shows 'S')

*   **How it works:** Bolio listens for a short phrase or sentence. When it detects a natural pause in your speech, it automatically stops listening, and the icon turns back to grey.
*   **When to use it:** Perfect for quick replies, filling out forms, or dictating one thought at a time.

#### b) Continuous Mode (Badge shows 'C')

*   **How it works:** Bolio keeps listening, even if you pause. It's designed for longer dictation, like writing a whole paragraph or an entire email without interruption.
*   **When to use it:** Use this when you have a lot to say and don't want the microphone to turn off between thoughts.

### 4. Stopping is Easy

You have two simple ways to stop dictation at any time:
1.  **Click the 'X' button** next to the icon.
2.  **Press the `Esc` key** on your keyboard.

If you click away from the text box, Bolio is smart enough to stop automatically and disappear, keeping your page clean.

### 5. Appending vs. Replacing Text

In the options page, you can choose how Bolio handles existing text.

*   **Append (Default):** If there's already text in the box, Bolio will smartly add a space and then append your new dictation.
*   **Replace:** If you enable this option, Bolio will completely clear the text box the moment you start dictating, giving you a fresh start.

## Installation (Getting Bolio into Your Browser)

Bolio is a browser extension, which means you need to add it to your web browser. Here's how:

### For Chrome, Edge, or Opera:

1.  **Download Bolio:** You'll get the Bolio files (usually in a `.zip` file). Unzip them into a folder on your computer.
2.  **Open Extensions Page:**
    *   **Chrome:** Type `chrome://extensions/` into your browser's address bar and press Enter.
    *   **Edge:** Type `edge://extensions/` into your browser's address bar and press Enter.
    *   **Opera:** Type `opera://extensions/` into your browser's address bar and press Enter.
3.  **Enable Developer Mode:** On the extensions page, look for a toggle switch labeled "Developer mode" and turn it on.
4.  **Load Bolio:** Click the "Load unpacked" button (or similar) and select the folder where you unzipped the Bolio files.

That's it! Bolio should now appear in your list of extensions and be ready to use.

## Need to Change Settings?

You can customize Bolio's behavior! Right-click on the Bolio icon in your browser's toolbar (usually near the address bar) and select "Options". Here, you can:

*   Choose the **language** you'll be speaking in.
*   Set whether you prefer "Normal" or "Continuous" mode as your **default**.
*   Decide if Bolio should **add new text** to what's already in the box, or **replace** it entirely.
