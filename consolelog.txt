✦ I'm ready to continue, but I'm still waiting for the console output to debug the floating icon visibility issue. I cannot proceed with fixing that
  specific problem without the requested information.

  To help me pinpoint why the icon is still not appearing on initial focus, please:


   1. Reload your extension in Chrome (go to chrome://extensions, enable "Developer mode", and click the refresh icon for Bolio).
   2. Open the developer console (usually by pressing F12 or right-clicking and selecting "Inspect") on a page with a text input field.
   3. Click into a text input field on that page for the very first time after reloading the extension.
   4. Check the console for messages starting with "Bolio:".


  Please provide the entire output from the console, especially any errors or messages related to "Bolio:", and describe the behavior you observe.
  This will help me understand if the recent changes have improved the situation and what further adjustments are needed.


  In the meantime, I'll update the tasks.md to reflect that I'm still debugging this issue.

│    content.js:359 Bolio: Text to set: OK so the Polio has startedI'm let's begin afterwardsok so it again has startedso continuous speech has started  │
│    now and let's see how it is going to work then I am also thinking to have the visibility of this working so it is working actually as of now as you │
│     can see the mic icon is not changing its position it is fixed like where it is so what is going on right now is the text is being underline below  │
│    the mic icon like which we have inserted the floating icon and I think it's not a good feature may be we can shift it somewhere on the left side or │
│     right side I am not sure like maybe we can just have it a little differentokay so with continuous speech what I have notice is the mic do get      │
│    disable after a little while which is I think could be okay it's not the bad but if I am already having a text and if continuous is there I think   │
│    should be have a space or maybe I could a manually at this place it's not a big deal and maybe we can decide on this late Rohan in future but as of │
│     not working                                                                                                                                        │
